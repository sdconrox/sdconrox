### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shane, and this is my GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on many, many things. All of which may or may not be important.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kubernetes and its many, many related services.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment, but I'll reach out if something peaks my interest.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with just about everything but this defaults to whatever I'm learning above.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about AWS, bash, zsh, macOS, Linux, Cloud Architecture, Serverless, and whatever else really. I love to help when I can.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: See https://sdconrox.com for the current primary method.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm one of the [many?] silly humans that ordered a lordship from establishedtitles.com (yes feel free to call me "Lord Conroy")
